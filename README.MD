# Policy Consensus Framework

**Founding Author:** Zach Phillips
**Founded:** September 27, 2025
**Status:** Early Development / Scaffolding Phase

## Overview

The Policy Consensus Framework is an ambitious project to develop a structured, non-partisan approach for building consensus on complex policy issues. Born from the recognition that current political discourse often amplifies division rather than facilitating meaningful resolution, this framework aims to provide tools for constructive dialogue across diverse perspectives.

Please see [charter.md](charter.md) for a full breakdown of the project's goals.
