# Project Roadmap

**Last Updated:** September 28, 2025
**Current Version:** 0.2 (Second Major Revision)

## Project Status

The Policy Consensus Framework is in active early development, transitioning from foundational scaffolding to structured framework development. We have established core documentation, implementation modalities, and identified key research areas.

### Recent Accomplishments (v0.2)

‚úÖ **Framework Documentation**
- Comprehensive key concepts glossary with cross-references
- Initial implementation guidance for both Small Group Mode and Platform Mode
- Detailed process documentation structure established

‚úÖ **Structural Improvements**
- Two-tier implementation modality (4-49 participants vs 50+ participants)
- Clear distinction between framework principles and implementation specifics
- Cross-document linking and navigation improvements

‚úÖ **Research Foundation**
- Decomposition process research framework established
- Identified key areas requiring empirical study
- Subphase artifact-driven approach outlined

## Immediate Priorities (Next 3 Months)

### 1. üî¨ Decomposition Process Research (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Goal**: Establish clear Problem Statement ‚Üí Assertion ‚Üí Premise relationships
**Current Status**: Research framework established, empirical testing needed
**Contribution Opportunities**:
- Academic researchers: Design and conduct small group pilots
- Process facilitators: Test decomposition approaches with real groups
- Technical writers: Document findings and refine process guidance

### 2. üìö Small Group Facilitation Materials (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Goal**: Create practical tools for Small Group Mode implementation
**Current Status**: Framework outlined, materials needed
**Contribution Opportunities**:
- Experienced facilitators: Develop session templates and guides
- Educators: Create training materials for new facilitators
- UX designers: Design participant worksheets and artifact templates

### 3. üèóÔ∏è Platform Mode Technical Specification (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Goal**: Define technical requirements for large-scale implementation
**Current Status**: Conceptual framework complete, technical specs needed
**Contribution Opportunities**:
- Software architects: Design scalable platform architecture
- UX/UI designers: Create user interface mockups and workflows
- Data scientists: Develop consensus aggregation algorithms

### 4. üß™ Pilot Implementation Program (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Goal**: Test framework effectiveness in real-world settings
**Current Status**: Implementation guidance ready, pilots needed
**Contribution Opportunities**:
- Community organizers: Organize local pilot groups
- Academic institutions: Integrate into research or coursework
- Policy organizations: Test on real policy issues

## Longer-Term Goals (6-12 Months)

### Academic Validation
- Peer-reviewed research on framework effectiveness
- Comparative studies across different implementation approaches
- Publication in policy, political science, or public administration journals

### Technical Development
- Working prototype of Platform Mode implementation
    - User validation process to ensure platform integrity 

### Community Building
- Contributor network and governance structure
- Training and certification programs for facilitators
- User community and feedback systems
