# Decomposition Process

**Status:** Active Research and Development

## Overview

Decomposition is the foundational process of the Policy Consensus Framework that breaks complex policy issues into manageable, discussable components. This document outlines the systematic approach for deconstructing Problem Statements into Assertions and then into Premises.

## Process Objectives

The decomposition process aims to:
1. Transform broad, complex policy positions into specific, testable components
2. Identify the core logical foundations underlying policy disagreements
3. Create a structured pathway for evidence-based discussion
4. Enable focused research and validation on key contentious points
5. Facilitate clearer communication across different perspectives

## Process Flow

### Stage 1: Problem Statement Identification
**Input**: Complex policy issue or broad concern
**Output**: Well-defined Problem Statement(s)

**Process**:
- Participants identify specific policy concerns or dissatisfactions
- Problem statements are explicitly linked to existing policies or policy gaps
- Statements are refined for clarity and scope

**Quality Criteria**:
- Directly references specific policies or policy areas
- Avoids overly broad generalizations
- Represents genuine participant concerns

### Stage 2: Assertion Extraction
**Input**: Problem Statement
**Output**: Set of Assertions that support the problem statement

**Process**: *[Under Active Research]*
- Break down the problem statement into its component logical arguments
- Extract key supporting concepts that underpin the problem statement
- Ensure assertions are more precise and specific than the original statement

**Research Questions**:
- What is the optimal relationship between Problem Statements and Assertions? (1:many, many:many?)
- How do we ensure assertions capture the essential logic without losing meaning?
- What guidelines help participants effectively decompose complex statements?

### Stage 3: Premise Identification
**Input**: Assertion
**Output**: Set of Premises that form the foundation of the assertion

**Process**: *[Under Active Research]*
- Identify the fundamental assumptions or beliefs underlying each assertion
- Decompose assertions to their most basic, testable components
- Ensure premises are simple enough for clear support/reject responses

**Research Questions**:
- How granular should premises be to enable effective consensus evaluation?
- What is the relationship between Assertions and Premises? (1:many, many:many?)
- How do we prevent over-decomposition that loses meaningful context?

## Implementation Variations

### Small Group Mode (4-49 participants)
- Facilitated group discussion guides the decomposition
- Verbal consensus on assertion and premise formulation
- Collaborative refinement through iterative discussion
- Human moderator ensures quality and completeness

### Platform Mode (50+ participants)
- Structured forms and workflows for systematic decomposition
- Crowdsourced suggestion and refinement of assertions/premises
- Voting mechanisms to validate decomposition quality
- Algorithmic clustering of similar assertions/premises

## Active Research Areas

### Relationship Structure
- **Current Status**: Under investigation
- **Key Questions**:
  - Should assertions link 1:1 or 1:many with problem statements?
  - Can premises support multiple assertions effectively?
  - How do we handle cross-cutting themes that appear across multiple statements?

### Decomposition Depth
- **Current Status**: Needs empirical testing
- **Key Questions**:
  - What level of granularity optimizes discussion effectiveness?
  - How do we balance simplicity with meaningful content?
  - At what point does decomposition become counterproductive?

### Quality Assurance
- **Current Status**: Framework needed
- **Key Questions**:
  - What criteria determine effective decomposition?
  - How do we prevent bias in the decomposition process?
  - What training or guidance do facilitators/participants need?

## Validation Framework

### Process Effectiveness Metrics
- Participant comprehension and engagement
- Quality of evidence evaluation at premise level
- Consensus achievement rates
- Time efficiency of the process

### Output Quality Metrics
- Logical coherence of decomposition chains
- Comprehensiveness of premise coverage
- Reusability of assertions and premises across topics
- Clarity and testability of final premises

## Next Steps

1. **Empirical Testing**: Conduct small group pilots to test decomposition approaches
2. **Relationship Mapping**: Clarify optimal linking structures between objects
3. **Facilitation Guidelines**: Develop training materials and process guides
4. **Quality Frameworks**: Establish criteria for effective decomposition
5. **Platform Requirements**: Define technical specifications for systematic implementation
