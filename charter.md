# Policy Consensus Framework
**Founding Author: Zach Phillips** - **Founding Date: 9-27-25**

## Project Background
The current political divide across the world highlights citizen's lack of a reliable framework to navigate information complexity and establish consensus on key issues. The internet and 'always online' culture have created new dynamics in how we discuss societal and political issues, while current social media discourse patterns often amplify division rather than facilitate resolution.

The scope of policy issues society faces is too vast, with too much historical context, for any individual to be fully informed on all topics. Yet social pressures toward conformity create expectations to hold strong opinions on every issue early in life, often before personal beliefs can mature through experience and reflection.

The idea for this framework emerged from personal experience engaging in political discussions with someone holding very different worldviews. Despite our differences, we consistently reached consensus on most topicsâ€”except when discussions became too detailed or relied on extensive historical context. In these moments, we faced a choice: either spend days researching to support our positions, or agree to disagree. Neither of us had the time or energy for thorough research, even though we recognized it as the right approach.

This pattern revealed a core challenge: average citizens rarely have sufficient time or resources to become truly informed on complex issues. Additionally, politically and financially motivated sources often present varying interpretations of historical context, making objective research difficult and time-consuming.

Even when I invested in extended research on a topic, achieving clarity on background information didn't bring me closer to contributing meaningful solutions that could benefit everyone. From this experience, the idea for developing a policy consensus framework that would help facilitate the entire process and connect the dots from discussion to policy recommendation emerged. 


## Project Mission
**To develop a framework that allows any set of individuals to:**
 1. To identify any set of key issues that are important to the group.
 2. For those individual issues, identify a set of problems statements about the key issues.
 3. For those problem statements, be able to further decompose them down to a set of more concise perspectives that are held by some portion of that group.
 4. For each perspective, identify key premises that serve as cornerstone arguments for why the supporting individuals in the group think that way.
 5. For each premise, provide a mechanism to collect artifacts that either support or reject the premise.
 6. Provide a process for individuals participating in the development of this body of knowledge to indicate which artifacts were most trustworthy and reliable inputs into the conversation.
 7. Provide at least an initial amount of guidance for how to work through considering a premise sufficiently resolved, even if there isn't perfect agreement (this is not the goal of this project).
 8. Provide a mechanism to propose policy changes that address the problem statements.
 9. Lastly, Provide a way for individuals of the group to showcase their support for these policy proposals, ultimately facilitating the identification of approaches that can be mutually supported, even by groups that have very different world-views.

An ambitious task to be sure, but one that felt both directionally _right_ and one that I believed had the chance to be actually effective.

## Proposed Benefits

The main premise for why I think this approach has a chance to work goes back to the original narrative. Topics are too big to effectively research, we all face too much pressure to have a strong opinion about every topic, and the discussion has to span over too long of a time period for the average person to stay engaged or organized.

The proposed benefits of this approach are:
- Topics get functionally broken down into more and more manageable bites. Concepts get simpler, and easier to discuss.
- No side or perspective is excluded from making good faith contribution to the effort
- The framework makes it much easier to understand where a group has gotten on a discussion and what remains to be discussed. _Implementation approaches are detailed in [framework/implementation.md](framework/implementation.md)_
- The framework attempts to guide people into thinking about topics at a more granular level, and to invest more energy into the nuance of a situation. It seeks first to understand an issue, its challenges, and valid perspectives held by real humans before attempting to influence an individual to reconsider any of their currently held beliefs.
- It places its focus on producing actual improvements in the form of policy proposals. This is a focus on alignment rather than division.
- It highlights key premises where there is the most division. The goal here is to showcase which cornerstone arguments actually contribute to our strongest disagreements. This can hopefully serve as a much more focused basis for research and transparent discussion. Some of these topics might lack conclusive evidence to support either side, this helps identify which topics we can focus our attention on for continued study.

## Key Tenets

Guiding the project should be a set of key tenets that influence continued development. Listed in priority order (the first being the highest priority of the project)

1. The ultimate goal of the project is to increase the shared quality of life for all humans, regardless of any defining personal characteristic or circumstance.
2. No one should be prevented from participating or contributing to the group discourse.
3. Process has to exist to dictate consistent outcomes when considering change, specifically to avoid oversized influence from any one source.
4. Every aspect of this framework is subject for debate or future revision (including these tenets). Change of such a foundational aspect of the framework has to be subject to tenet 3. _Initial guidance for updating the charter to be determined and approved by founder prior to 1.0 release_

## Founding Perspectives
This project does not attempt to establish any specific belief or worldview as a singular correct position. It's focus is instead on creating a framework for a body of individuals to arrive at some degree of consensus, particularly in light of the complexity of issues humans now face.

That being said, even being willing to participate in this type of system requires some degree of desire to be involved in a systematic review and discussion about challenging topics. That's who this framework is ultimately for, people from all walks of life, who feel that other forms of discourse are failing us. 

I appreciate anyone who helps contribute to this effort and is willing to dedicate time to the mission of this project. If successful, I think it could really help.
